# Welcome to Spectral Metric
This library provides an implementation of CSG, from CVPR 2019 paper: [Spectral Metric for Dataset Complexity Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07299).

By using `spectral-metric` you can learn more about your dataset without training a model.

Spectral metric is **domain agnostic** and **fast** compared to previous state-of-the-art.[^1]

Spectral metric in action:

2. [In-depth analysis of CLINC-150](https://github.com/Dref360/spectral-metric/blob/master/notebooks/clinc_oos.ipynb)
